- perhaps we need a can't connect state for the health checks? Or is that defacto unhealthy?
- color on those statuses and icons! C'mon, man.
- get the openapi, types, schemas in an npm package? Or load directly from git?
- how do we want to show users? Probably a table, then a details/edit view?
- it looks like I could just copy out the icons I need and set the base path, but is that really the problem with the big bundle?
- maybe biome isn't a good fit for the front end, yet? Prettier doesn't do html or lit template literals, no linting for lit (and ?)
