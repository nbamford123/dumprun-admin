# Temporary ToDo File

## Admin site
- some type of validation method when update succeeds
- spinner on edit form when user is being loaded
- should the user be loaded from the users screen? Not found on the edit screen seems weird
- error messages are no good (not sending back validation errors) to non-existant (just ignore get/update failures)
- table doesn't have correct fields
- icon button in table for delete, w/ prompt
- implement the hybrid wc import suggested by claude
- look up burton's fouc fix
- perhaps we need a can't connect state for the health checks? Or is that defacto unhealthy?
- color on those statuses and icons! C'mon, man. Also latency, etc.
- get the openapi, types, schemas in an npm package? Or load directly from git?
- it looks like I could just copy out the icons I need and set the base path, but is that really the problem with the big bundle?
- maybe biome isn't a good fit for the front end, yet? Prettier doesn't do html or lit template literals, no linting for lit (and ?)
