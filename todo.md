# Temporary ToDo File

## Admin site
- maybe leave create/update errors on form, the notification is easy to miss
- error messages are no good (not sending back validation errors) to non-existant (just ignore get/update failures)
- surely the form components can have general similarities extracted out?
- ask ag-grid about the styling issues I encountererd using multiple grids from the npm package
- tests!!!
- failure to load grid shows no status just 'loading' state in grid
- ag-grid warnings in console
- some type of status message when update succeeds
- spinner on edit form when user is being loaded, spinner on create, spinner on delete. Spinners!
- should the user be loaded from the users screen? Not found on the edit screen seems weird
- table doesn't have correct fields
- look up burton's fouc fix
- perhaps we need a can't connect state for the health checks? Or is that defacto unhealthy?
- color on those statuses and icons! C'mon, man. Also latency, etc.
- get the openapi, types, schemas in an npm package? Or load directly from git?
- it looks like I could just copy out the icons I need they add about 8MB to the bundle
- maybe biome isn't a good fit for the front end, yet? Prettier doesn't do html or lit template literals, no linting for lit (and ?)
